## Getting Started

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

Your new site will be up at http://localhost:3000/

Blog posts can be added to the `posts` directory, in the root folder.

Update the `WEBSITE_HOST_URL` when taking your site live. This lives in `/src/lib/constants.ts`

Make sure to update the `sitemap.ts` file, specifically the `const routes` if you add more pages to the website.
